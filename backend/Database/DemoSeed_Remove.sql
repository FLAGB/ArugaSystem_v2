   ARUGA — REMOVE DEMO DATA
   Deletes everything DemoSeed.sql created (IDs starting A2A1…A2A7 and
   vaccine batches with lot numbers starting DEMO-), plus anything that
   was recorded ON those demo people during testing.
   The rooms (Room 1, Room 2, …) are real and stay; the demo health
   workers are just taken off them.
   Real (non-demo) data is left untouched.
